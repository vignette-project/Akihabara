# Deprecation Note

This library has been superseded by [MediaPipe.NET](https://github.com/vignetteapp/MediaPipe.NET), which has a more cleaner take to the library. As such, MediaPipe.NET
is a natural evolution from Akihabara's codebase and is much more predictable and maintainable. We will no longer provide maintenance to Akihabara.

# Akihabara

Akihabara is Vignette's pure .NET port of Mediapipe, based on [Junrou Nishida's](https://github.com/homuler) MediaPipeUnity project.

## Getting Started

Almost everything is done via the `build.py` script, so run this first. This will fetch the Mediapipe source, apply patches and finally compile the glue library + Mediapipe itself in one nifty small library. However, you will still need to do the dotnet side, which is just a matter of `dotnet build` after getting `setup.py` done.

Keep in mind Mediapipe supports both CPU and GPU so you will need to compile as such based on what you need:

If you want CPU (Recommended)

```
python3 build.py build --desktop cpu -vv
```

If you want GPU (Experimental, doesn't work yet!)

```
python3 build.py build --desktop gpu --vv
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 (We tried it with 3.8 but for some odd reason things were broken for this build. PRs welcome to fix this though!)
- .NET 5.0 or .NET 6.0 LTS
- GCC-9 (GCC-10 also works but not guranteed to work since Mediapipe uses a lot of deprecated syntax).
- Bazel
